(2) Training Modification: Reduce volume and intensity 50% across the board, Eliminate ALL maximum efforts (nothing >75% capacity), Focus exclusively on: Zone 2 aerobic work 20-30min (promotes parasympathetic, improves metabolic flexibility), Restorative yoga or gentle stretching 20-30min, Walking 30-60min daily (low-stress movement, nature exposure), Mobility work 15-20min (addresses tissue quality without fatigue). (3) Stress Mitigation: Identify and eliminate 2-3 chronic stressors (delegate work, defer projects, say no to obligations), Implement daily parasympathetic practice: 10-15min non-negotiable (breathwork, meditation, yoga nidra, nature walk), Reduce stimulants: Limit caffeine to morning only, <200mg total (it's masking fatigue, preventing recovery), Avoid alcohol completely during recovery phase (fragments sleep, impairs REM). (4) Nutritional Support: Increase protein to 1g/lb bodyweight (your body needs building blocks for repair), Focus on anti-inflammatory, nutrient-dense foods: Fatty fish 3x weekly (omega-3s—EPA/DHA reduce inflammation), Colorful vegetables 6-8 servings daily (antioxidants, polyphenols), High-quality carbohydrates around training (sweet potato, rice, oats—support glycogen, don't fear carbs in recovery), Healthy fats (avocado, olive oil, nuts—support hormones, reduce inflammation), Bone broth or collagen (gut health, joint support). Consider: Omega-3 supplement 2-3g daily (if not eating fish), Vitamin D 4000 IU (if deficient—common, affects immunity and mood), Magnesium bis-glycinate 400mg (most people deficient—critical for recovery), Adaptogenic support (Ashwagandha 600mg or Rhodiola 400mg—HPA axis support). (5) Recovery Modalities: Massage or bodywork 1-2x weekly (addresses tissue quality, promotes relaxation), Sauna 20min 3-4x weekly (cardiovascular health, heat shock proteins, relaxation), Cold therapy optional (some find it energizing, others find it stressful—listen to your body), Epsom salt baths 2-3x weekly (magnesium absorption, muscle relaxation), Spend time in nature (forest bathing, ocean, mountains—proven to reduce cortisol). (6) Monitor Progress: Track daily: Morning resting heart rate (should decrease as recovery improves), Sleep quality and energy upon waking (should improve within 3-5 days), Mood and motivation (emotional state is biological—tracks with physiology), Readiness feeling (subjective but valid—your body knows). Adjust based on feedback: If improving → continue protocol, If stagnant after 7 days → investigate deeper (consider functional medicine workup—thyroid, cortisol, micronutrients, gut health).",warning,Autonomic Nervous System,Autonomic Dysregulation: Sympathetic Dominance Detected (HRV: 41.5/100),"Felicia, HRV proxy 41.5/100 indicates sympathetic nervous system dominance.

(2) Stress Inoculation: Cold exposure 3x weekly (2-3min cold shower, focus on controlled breathing—builds stress resilience and increases norepinephrine baseline, improving focus and mood), Sauna 2-3x weekly (20min at 170-180°F—heat shock proteins improve stress resistance, enhance cardiovascular health), High-intensity interval training (brief, intense stimulus builds psychological resilience). (3) Cognitive Reframing: Implement 'stress appraisal' practice—when stressed, ask: 'Is this a threat or challenge?' (reappraisal reduces cortisol and improves performance), Journaling 10min pre-bed (externalizing worries reduces rumination and improves sleep), Gratitude practice (3 things daily—shifts focus, reduces stress perception). (4) Strategic Recovery: Schedule 1-2 'non-negotiable' recovery activities weekly (massage, float tank, sauna, social time—NOT optional), Protect 1 full rest day weekly (no training, no work email, no obligations), Midday breaks (even 5min away from screen reduces afternoon cortisol spike).
